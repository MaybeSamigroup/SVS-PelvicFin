  - SVS_BepisPlugins
- [CoastalSmell](https://github.com/MaybeSamigroup/SVS-Fishbone)

## Installation

Extract the [latest release](https://github.com/MaybeSamigroup/SVS-PelvicFin/releases/latest) to your game install directory.

## How to use

Start character creation or h scene in game; you'll see additional UI.

To show / hide the ui, you can use keyboard shortcut.

Ctrl + p is mapped as default and can be configured through plugin setting.

## Tips

Base color setting for simple figure is only applied to player character.

So, you should modify n_body_silhouette/n_tang_silhouette color properties of others via [SardineHead](https://github.com/MaybeSamigroup/SVS-SardineHead).
